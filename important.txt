When we use react-router-dom and netlify, there is a problem
when we change nav e.g to Projects and refresh the website => page not found

What to do?
1. In public make a file => netlify.toml
2. in netlify.toml:
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "./index.html"
  status = 200

3. npm run build
4. drag your dist folder in Netlify
